# Predict-Queue-Wait-Time---DBS6

We have all experienced waiting in long queues in hospital before we get treated. At times, it can be frustrating to wait and the patient's bad health adds the fuel to fire. But what if there is a way by which we can find out how much time we will have to wait in the hospital (based on live data) ?
This is where our project comes in which will tell us the approximate queue wait time even before you enter the hospital and an exact time once you register on hospital reception !

This web app has 4 features (and ways to use it explained in a sequence):

1. Doctor's Availability : While you are at home and if you feel any kind of health issue, you can login into our app and see this section where in every doctor's timetable and his working hours are displayed along with his qualification and his OPD. You can check the doctor's working hours and your free schedule (more important for office persons who have time constraint). If it matches, you may think of visiting the hospital . If not, you may see another slot.
